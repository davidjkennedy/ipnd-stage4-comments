Inside OS is listdir and rename even though we might not exactly know how these functions work we can use them. This hidding of detail is another example of Abstraction. os.renames() - Recursive directory or file renaming function. Works like rename(), except creation of any intermediate directories needed to make the new pathname good is attempted first. After therename, directories corresponding to rightmost path segments of the old name will be pruned away using removedirs()."""},
